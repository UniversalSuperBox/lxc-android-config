# ureadahead - Read required files in advance for touch mountpoints
#
# Runs the Ã¼ber-readahead daemon which reads data about files required
# during boot and reads them into the page cache in advance of their
# use.
# Since on touch devices all mounting happens in initrd, mountall does 
# not emit the right mount events for us so we iterate over the .pack
# files instead to preload files on boot.
